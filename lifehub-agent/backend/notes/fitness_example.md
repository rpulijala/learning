# Fitness Notes

## Weekly Running Plan

I've been following a simple running schedule:
- Monday: 3 mile easy run
- Wednesday: 5 mile tempo run
- Friday: 3 mile recovery run
- Sunday: Long run (7-10 miles)

## Strength Training

I do strength training on Tuesday and Thursday:
- Squats: 3 sets of 10
- Deadlifts: 3 sets of 8
- Bench press: 3 sets of 10
- Pull-ups: 3 sets to failure
- Planks: 3 sets of 60 seconds

## Recovery Tips

- Always stretch after running
- Foam rolling helps with tight muscles
- Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep
- Stay hydrated throughout the day
- Take rest days seriously

## Goals

My current fitness goals:
1. Run a half marathon in under 2 hours
2. Increase squat weight to 200 lbs
3. Improve flexibility with daily stretching
